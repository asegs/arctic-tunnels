The rocks that grow out of the sea … ;
the monstrous seas;
the female that dwells in those mountainous waves,
whose tresses wave about in the water and on the surface of the sea;
and the frozen sea of pia,
with the deceitful animal of the sea who dives to great depths —
a foggy, misty and dark place not seen by the sun.
